### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Thomas Laure!

I'm a french Software Engineer specializing in web technologies. I like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions and quick hacks, and I'm on track for learning more about development in general, eco-design and security.

In my free time, I love reading books, listening podcasts about many subjets such as philosophy, nature, environment, human rights or tech.

Please have a look at my [Portfolio](https://thomaslaure.fr/) for more details about me. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
