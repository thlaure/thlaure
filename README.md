### Hi there 👋, I am Thomas Laure!

I'm a french Software Engineer and fullstack web developer. I like to explore new technologies and develop software solutions and quick hacks, and I'm on track for learning more about development in general, eco-design and security.

In my free time, I love reading books, listening podcasts about many subjets such as philosophy, nature, energy, environment, human rights or tech, or make a lot of surveillance about development, marketing, e-commerce, management and many others professional skills.

Please have a look at my [portfolio](https://thomaslaure.fr/) for more details about me. I'm open to feedback and suggestions!
